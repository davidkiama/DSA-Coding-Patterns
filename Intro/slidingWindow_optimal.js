/*
The efficient way to solve this problem would be to visualize 
each subarray as a sliding window of ‘5’ elements. This means 
that we will slide the window by one element when we move on 
to the next subarray. To reuse the sum from the previous 
subarray, we will subtract the element going out of the window 
and add the element now being included in the sliding window. 
This will save us from going through the whole subarray to find 
the sum and, as a result, the algorithm complexity will reduce to O(N).
